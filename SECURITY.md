## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository (Security tab, "Report a vulnerability") rather than a public issue. Include the version, the command you ran (with the server URL redacted if needed) and the `--json` output if you have it.

You will get an acknowledgement within 7 days and a fix or a mitigation plan within 30 days for confirmed issues. Credit is given in the release notes unless you prefer otherwise.

## What the tool does on the network

By default `mcp-auth-doctor` only reads:

- one unauthenticated `POST` of a JSON-RPC `initialize` message to the MCP URL you give it (to provoke the 401 challenge),
- `GET` requests for the protected resource metadata and authorization server metadata documents at their well-known locations,
- one `POST` to the token endpoint with a deliberately invalid authorization code, to see whether the error comes back as `application/json`. This creates no state on the server and uses no credentials.

Two flags are opt-in and documented in the README because they go beyond reading:

- `--dcr-probe` sends one dynamic client registration request (`application_type: "native"`, redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:1/callback`, no client secret). Authorization servers that accept it will create a throwaway client record; the tool never uses it.
- `--login` runs the full OAuth 2.1 authorization code flow with PKCE: it registers a client (unless you pass `--client-id`), opens your browser, receives the code on a loopback listener bound to 127.0.0.1, redeems it, and calls `tools/list` once with the access token. The access token is held in memory for that one call and is never written to disk or printed; the report shows only its type, lifetime and scope.

The tool refuses plain `http://` URLs for anything other than localhost and 127.0.0.1, follows redirects only for metadata `GET` requests, and never sends the `Authorization` header to a host other than the MCP URL you gave it.

## Scope

Issues of interest: anything that makes the tool send credentials or tokens where it should not, follow a redirect it should not, print a secret, or misreport a check in a way that would lead someone to deploy an insecure configuration (for example reporting PKCE as supported when it is not). Findings the tool produces about a server are not vulnerabilities in the tool; for those, open a normal issue.
